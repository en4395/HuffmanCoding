# Private_Library
A personal library management system

OVERVIEW:
Private Library is a library management for my home library. No more stealing my books, you're on 
a tight deadline!

OBJECTIVES:
My objectives for this project: 
- To practice some Java syntax and constructs that I was unsure about.
- To apply DSA concepts, notably using the most relevant data structures for a given application, 
  and applying knowledge of sorting algorithms to different data types.
- To discover and make use of cool Java packages.
